# Roller Derby Track

This project is intended to create a model roller derby track which conforms to the [WFTDA rules](http://wftda.com/rules).

[Demo here](http://aubergene.com/roller-derby-track/)

Ideally I'd like to add detection for "no pack", and "out of play" situations and highlight when the game is in that state.

Please feel free to suggest changes, the code is very rough as I'm learning as I go. It was adapted originally from [Mr Doob's Ball Pool](http://mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/ball_pool/).
